Solutions and Tests to Common Algorithms Using Golang

## Testing

To Run Tests:

```bash
go test ./...
```

## Problems Completed

1. Maximum Subarray Sum - Initially Done Using A Double For Loop But Reworked with Kadane's Algorithm to Improve Speed (_From CodeWars_)
2. Remove Duplicates From Sorted Array - In place algorithm with constant space, uses pointers. Not quite the two pointer solution but close (_From Leetcode_)
